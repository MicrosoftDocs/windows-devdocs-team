# #88 The `this` pointer (Part 3)

In [#41. C++ iterators](041.md), we used the [indirection operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/indirection-operator-star) (*). The indirection operator is used to turn any pointer-to-an-object into the object itself. That's called *dereferencing* a pointer.

* We've seen that, inside a **MyStruct** member function, `this` is of type **MyStruct**\* (pointer to **MyStruct**).
* So the expression `*this` is of type **MyStruct**.

Here's that same info illustrated in code.

```cpp
MyStruct* myStructPointer{ this };
MyStruct myStructCopy{ *this };
```

So an alternative to this...

```cpp
return (this->Count == rhs.Count);
```

...is this.

```cpp
return ((*this).Count == rhs.Count);
```

In fact, there's no practical need for syntax like `(*this).Count`, but it does illustrate that when you dereference the `this` pointer, you get an object of value type. And so you'd "dot into" that if you needed to (that is, you'd use the dot form of the [member access operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/member-access-operators-dot-and)).

On the other hand, there are times when you *need* the expression `*this`. They're rare, though, so if you're curious you can see three examples of it in the topic [Author APIs with C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/author-apis).

And now we're ready to look at overloading the inequality operator!
