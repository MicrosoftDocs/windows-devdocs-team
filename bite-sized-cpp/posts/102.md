# #102 Static member functions

[Static](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/static-members-cpp) member functions&mdash;like static data members&mdash;can be used without needing an instance (that is, an object) of a type. At least in that respect, static member functions are similar to free functions (see [#90 Free functions vs member functions](090.md)). But a static member function (or data member) needs to be public if you want to access it directly from outside of its type.

And there are limitations to what you can do in a static member function versus an instance member function. Because a static member function belongs to the entire type, and not to any specific instance, it lacks a `this` pointer. So you don't have access to instance data members nor instance member functions. However, you still have access to *static* data members and member functions.

```cpp
struct MathLibStruct
{
    static const float Pi(){ return m_pi; }
private:
    static const float m_pi;
};

const float MathLibStruct::m_pi{ 3.14159274f };

int main()
{
    std::wcout << MathLibStruct::Pi() << std::endl;
}
```

Notice that the **MathLibStruct::Pi** member function returns a constant floating-point value. But that doesn't make **MathLibStruct::Pi** a `const` (or constant) member function. We'll learn what a constant member function is next time.
