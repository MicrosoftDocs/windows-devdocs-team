# #38. Writing a string to output (Part 1)

It's convenient to be able to output a string to the console, or to write a trace string to Visual Studio's [**Output** window](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/reference/output-window). We'll look at how to do both.

One option for writing to the console is to continue to use functions originally from the C standard I/O library. For example, the function [**printf**](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/printf-printf-l-wprintf-wprintf-l), or the wide-string **wprintf**.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
wprintf(L"Hello, World!");
// Prints "Hello, World!" with no line-break after it.
```

Why doesn't `cstdio` have a `.h` in its name? We'll talk about that in the next post.

You can write a string to Visual Studio's **Output** window by calling the Windows API [**OutputDebugStringW**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/debugapi/nf-debugapi-outputdebugstringw), and then **Start Debugging (F5)** in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). This works for both console apps and Windows apps.

```cpp
#include <windows.h>
::OutputDebugStringW(L"Hello, World!");
// Outputs "Hello, World!" with no line-break after it.
```

Going back to **wprintf** for a moment, here's an example of formatted text.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
wprintf(L"Pi is approximately %.2f.\r\n", 22.f / 7.f);
// Prints "Pi is approximately 3.14." with a line-break after it.
```

You can use C++ *streams* to output formatted text, too. We'll look at them next time.
