# #87 The `this` pointer (Part 2)

Now let's consider this code.

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    int Count{ 0 };
    bool operator==(MyStruct const& rhs)
    {
        int Count{ 99 }; // warning C4458: declaration of 'Count' hides class member
        return (Count == rhs.Count); // `Count` refers to the local automatic variable
    }
};
```

By declaring both a data member named *Count* and (inside **operator==**) a local automatic variable named *Count*, we've made the token `Count` ambiguous. The compiler resolves that ambiguity by taking `Count` to mean the local automatic variable.

That's not what we want in this case. But we can fix that by being explicit about which *Count* we mean, like this:

```cpp
bool operator==(MyStruct const& rhs)
{
    int Count{ 99 }; // warning C4458: declaration of 'Count' hides class member
    return (this->Count == rhs.Count); `this->Count` refers to the data member
}
```

We've said that the C++ `this` keyword roughly means "this object". And it's *a pointer to* "this object". So inside of a **MyStruct** member function, `this` is a pointer to a **MyStruct**. Not just any old **MyStruct**&mdash;it's a pointer to the **MyStruct** on which the member function was called.

And since `this` is a pointer, we use the arrow form of the [member access operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/member-access-operators-dot-and) with it. And you can use `this` with data members *or* with member functions.
