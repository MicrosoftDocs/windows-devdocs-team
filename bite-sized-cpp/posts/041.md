# #41. C++ iterators

An *iterator* is an object that's very much like a pointer. You can use one to enumerate the contents of a container, moving it along and pointing at each element in turn. In other words, you use an iterator to *iterate* over the collection, one element at a time.

Let's get an iterator from the vector that we created last time (in [#40. C++ containers](040.md)).

```cpp
auto it = fruit.begin();
```

Whereas the [**front**](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/vector-class#front) function we saw last time returns a reference to the first *element*, the [**begin**](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/vector-class#begin) function here returns an iterator. Remember: an iterator isn't the same thing as an element. An iterator is more like *a pointer to an element*.

The `auto` keyword is very similar to `var` in C#. Using `auto` means that we don't have to trouble ourselves with the type of iterator that we're working with. Here, the actual type of the variable named *it* (I named it to be short for *iterator*) happens to be `std::vector<std::wstring>::iterator`. Each container type has its own set of [iterators](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/vector-class#typedefs) (forward and reverse, non-constant and constant).

Since an iterator points to an element, we can access that element by *dereferencing* the iterator. And we dereference using the [indirection operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/indirection-operator-star) (*). If you know about pointers, then this will look familiar.

```cpp
std::wcout << *it << L" is a fruit" << std::endl;
// Prints "pear is a fruit" with a line-break after it.
```
