# #108 Overriding

For implementation inheritance, a derived class can choose to override any implementation that it has inherited from the base class. Here's an example.

```cpp
struct WheeledMotorVehicle
{
    void Drive() { /* base-class implementation goes here */ }
};

struct Car : public WheeledMotorVehicle
{
    void Drive() { /* overridden implementation goes here */ }
};
```

Engineering-wise, it often makes sense for a derived class like **Car** to do some very car-specific work in its **Drive** method, and to call its base class's **Drive** method either before or after that. And you can do that by using the [`__super`](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/super) keyword, like this:

```cpp
struct Car : public WheeledMotorVehicle
{
    void Drive()
    {
        // Perhaps some car-specific work here.
        __super::Drive();
        // And perhaps some here.
    }
};
```

But `__super` isn't Standard C++. So if you're not using a Microsoft compiler, then an alternative is to specify the base class by name, as in `WheeledMotorVehicle::Drive();`.

We'll soon be talking about the magic of virtual functions. **WheeledMotorVehicle::Drive** and **Car::Drive** are not virtual (instead, you might think of them as *actual* functions). And there's not much magic about them, as you can see in this next code example.

```cpp
void DriveAWheeledMotorVehicle(WheeledMotorVehicle & wmv)
{
    wmv.Drive(); // Always calls WheeledMotorVehicle::Drive
}

void DriveACar(Car & car)
{
    car.Drive(); // Always calls Car::Drive
}
```

Think about, and internalize, the code comments above. After we've introduced virtual functions, we'll see a function very similar to **DriveAWheeledMotorVehicle** that does something much more interesting than always calling the same member function.
