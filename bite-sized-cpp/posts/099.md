# #99 A parameterized constructor

*Default* constructors (ones that take no parameters) are the only kind of constructor we've looked at so far. So now let's look at a constructor that *does* take parameters. Here's an example.

```cpp
struct MyStructParameterizedConstructor
{
    MyStructParameterizedConstructor(int count) : Count { count }
    {
    }
    int Count;
};
```

The only way to construct a **MyStructParameterizedConstructor** is via its user-defined parameterized constructor. That's why we don't need a default member initializer for *Count*. Instead, we take the value of *Count* as a constructor parameter, and use a member initializer list to initialize *Count* with the value of that parameter.

```cpp
int main()
{
    MyStructParameterizedConstructor s1(99); // s1::Count == 99
    auto s2{ MyStructParameterizedConstructor(99) }; // s2::Count == 99
    MyStructParameterizedConstructor s3{}; // error C2512: no appropriate default constructor available
    MyStructParameterizedConstructor s4{ 99 }; // s4::Count == 99
}
```

* *s1* and *s2* both cause our user-defined parameterized constructor to be invoked.
* *s3* wants to invoke a default constructor (because **MyStructParameterizedConstructor** is *not* an aggregate), but it doesn't find one.
* *s4* is the most interesting of the variables. It uses uniform initialization to invoke the user-defined parameterized constructor.

Over the past half-dozen or more posts, we've encountered some pretty subtle rules. But things can be simple if you just define your own parameterized constructor(s), and create objects by using uniform initialization.
