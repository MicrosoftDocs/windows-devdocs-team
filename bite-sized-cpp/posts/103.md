# #103 Constant member functions

When you declare an instance member function as `const`, you make a promise that nothing in the implementation of that member function will modify the instance. Consider this type:

```cpp
struct Circle
{
    Circle(float radius) : m_radius{ radius } {}
private:
    float m_radius;
};
```

Now imagine a **Circle::Area** member function. You can calculate the area of a **Circle** simply by *reading* the value of **Circle::m_radius**. There's no need to modify anything about the state of the object just to get its area. So in a situation like that, it's a good practice to define **Circle::Area** with the `const` keyword, like this:

```cpp
struct Circle
{
    ...
    float Area() const { return 3.14159274f * m_radius * m_radius; }
    ...
};
```

That's a constant member function. And inside a constant member function, the compiler sets the type of `this` to be constant. So inside **Circle::Area**, the type of `this` is `const Circle*`. The benefit is that you can call a constant member function on either a non-const or a const instance of the type. Like this:

```cpp
int main()
{
    Circle circle1{ 1.5f };
    const Circle circle2{ 1.5f };
    std::wcout << circle1.Area() << std::endl;
    std::wcout << circle2.Area() << std::endl;
}
```

If we hadn't declared **Circle::Area** as `const`, then the compiler would have prevented us from calling that function on a constant object such as `circle2`. Specify `const` whenever you can, and thereby maximize the functions that you can call on constant objects.
