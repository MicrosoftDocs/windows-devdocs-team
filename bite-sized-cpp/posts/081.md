# #81. Assign using references

Consider this function.

```cpp
void AssignUsingReferences(MyStruct& myStructRef1, MyStruct& myStructRef2)
{
    myStructRef1 = myStructRef2;
}
```

Remember that (conceptually) a reference *is* its referent. So that assignment is (on the right-hand side) reading the value of whatever the referent is of *myStructRef2*. And then (on the left-hand side) assigning that value to whatever the referent is of *myStructRef1*.

So now let's look at that function in action, with some actual known referents. If the explanation above made sense of what the function does, then the code below, and its comments, will make sense, too.

```cpp
int main()
{
    MyStruct myStruct1; // myStruct1::Count == 0
    MyStruct myStruct2{ 99 }; // myStruct1::Count == 99

    AssignUsingReferences(myStruct1, myStruct2);

    std::wcout << myStruct1.Count << std::endl; // prints 99
    std::wcout << myStruct2.Count << std::endl; // prints 99
}
```

At first, the value of *myStruct1.Count* is 0; and the value of *myStruct.Count* is 99. Then we call the function. Calling the function is equivalent to `myStruct1 = myStruct2`.

And the result is that the *Count* member of both instances is equal to 99.
