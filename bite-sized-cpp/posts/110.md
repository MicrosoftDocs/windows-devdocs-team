# #110 A code example of polymorphism

We're now ready to put into place all of the pieces that we've learned over the past few posts, and look at a full code example showing polymorphism in practice. This is based on the idea of the hierarchy of graphics shapes that we described in [#106 Polymorphism](106.md).

```cpp
struct Shape
{
    virtual std::wstring Draw() const = 0;
};

struct Circle : public Shape
{
    std::wstring Draw() const override { return L"A drawing of a Circle"; }
};

struct Square : public Shape
{
    std::wstring Draw() const override { return L"A drawing of a Square"; }
};

struct Triangle : public Shape
{
    std::wstring Draw() const override { return L"A drawing of a Triangle"; }
};

void DrawAShape(Shape const& shape)
{
    std::wcout << shape.Draw() << std::endl; // Uses dynamic dispatch to call the appropriate implementation of Drive.
}

int main()
{
    Circle circle;
    Square square;
    Triangle triangle;

    DrawAShape(circle);
    DrawAShape(square);
    DrawAShape(triangle);
}
```

The program above outputs this text:

A drawing of a Circle

A drawing of a Square

A drawing of a Triangle
