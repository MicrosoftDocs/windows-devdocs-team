# #78. What it means to *seat* a reference

We're going to talk about *re*-seating a reference in the next post. So it seems logical before that to offer a concept of what *seating* means in the context of a reference.

Here's the version of **MyStruct** that we'll be using for the next few posts.

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    int Count{ 0 };
};
```

And here's **MyStruct** in use.

```cpp
int main()
{
    MyStruct myStruct;
    MyStruct& myStructRef{ myStruct }; // myStructRef is seated at this point
}
```

This kind of thing should look familiar by now.

First we declare an automatic variable named *myStruct*. It's of type **MyStruct**, so it's a value type. And then we declare *myStructRef*, and its type is a reference to a **MyStruct**. But it's always necessary to initialize a reference. And here we're initializing the reference named *myStructRef* with the value named*myStruct*.

So that's what seating is. It's just the idea of binding the reference variable to its referent.

Because we *must* initialize a reference, we *can't* do this kind of thing:

```cpp
MyStruct& myStructRef1; // error C2530
MyStruct& myStructRef2{}; // error C2440
```

The error message for *myStructRef1* is "references must be initialized". And *myStructRef2* doesn't make sense, because you can't zero-initialize a reference (which is what it looks like we're trying to do there).

So much for seating (or binding). Next time: re-seating!
