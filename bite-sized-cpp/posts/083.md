# #83. Identity (Part 2)

Because an object's identity is its memory address, we can use memory addresses to determine whether two objects have the same, or different, identities.

```cpp
auto a1{ std::addressof(myStruct1) };
auto a2{ std::addressof(myStruct2) };
if (a1 == a2) { ... }
```

In the code above, we use the [std::addressof](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/memory-functions#addressof) function (defined in the `<memory>` header) to get the memory addresses of *myStruct1* and *myStruct2*. In other words to get the *identities* of *myStruct1* and *myStruct2*. And then we can compare those two identities for equality.

In that example, *a1* is not equal to *a2*, of course. So let's write a general-purpose function to compare identities.

```cpp
bool CompareIdentities(MyStruct const& myStructRef1, MyStruct const& myStructRef2)
{
    return (std::addressof(myStructRef1) == std::addressof(myStructRef2));
}

int main()
{
    MyStruct myStruct1;
    MyStruct myStruct2;
    bool eq1{ CompareIdentities(myStruct1, myStruct1) }; // eq1 is true
    bool eq2{ CompareIdentities(myStruct1, myStruct2) }; // eq2 is false
}
```

You can see why the **CompareIdentities** function has to take its parameters by reference. If it took them by value, then we'd be creating two new (and entirely different) identities in the form of the copies, and so the function would always return `false`.
