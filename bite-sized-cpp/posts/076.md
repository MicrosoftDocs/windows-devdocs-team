# #76. Returning a reference

Now here's a slightly different version of **MyStruct**. The only difference is that the public function **Count** returns not an int, but a *reference* to an int. In other words it returns not a *value*, but a *reference*.

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    int& Count() { return m_count; }
private:
    int m_count{ 0 };
};
```

And here's some code that uses this new version of **MyStruct**.

```cpp
int main()
{
    MyStruct myStruct;
    ++myStruct.Count(); // increments m_count
    myStruct.Count() = 2; // sets m_count to 2
    std::wcout << myStruct.Count() << std::endl;
}
```

That prints 2. And the reason is because here, the expression `myStruct.Count()` evaluates to a reference to *m_count* (in other words, it evaluates to the location where *m_count* is stored). And that *is* an lvalue, so we can increment it or assign to it.
