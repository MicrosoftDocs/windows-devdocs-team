# #44. Range-based `for` (Part 1)

The C++ [range-based `for` statement](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/range-based-for-statement-cpp) is syntactically similar to the C# `foreach` statement.

Perhaps confusingly, though, C++ actually has its *own* `for_each` (part of the C++ Standard Library). And that's *different* from C#'s `foreach` statement. We'll examine the C++ `for_each` soon.

The syntax of the C++ range-based `for` is simpler than that of the regular C++ `for` statement that we looked at last time. As you can see in the example below, we simply declare a loop variable to represent the current element (named *el* in this case), and we specify the collection that we want to iterate over (although, with the range-based `for`, we think of the collection as being anything that can serve as a *range* of values).

```cpp
for (auto const& el : fruit)
{
    std::wcout << el << L" is a fruit" << std::endl;
}
```

We don't need to specify (or even know!) the element type; we can let *auto* take care of that (remember, it's similar to C#'s *var*). Declaring *el* as constant is a good practice because it means that we can't accidentally modify it during the loop. And the `&` syntax indicates that we're not *copying* the element (which might be expensive), but rather *referencing* it. We'll talk about references another time.

And next time we'll look at how the range-based for statement works under the covers.
