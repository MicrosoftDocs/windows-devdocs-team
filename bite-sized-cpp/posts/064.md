# #64. Functions that take values (Part 1)

In the next few posts we're going to explore functions that take parameters of value type (or values), and functions that take parameters of reference type (or references). We'll contrast those two kinds of function, and look at their pros and cons. Let's start with functions that take values.

Here's a function being defined, and then called.

```cpp
void TakeIntByValue(int myIntParameter)
{
    ...
}

int main()
{
    int myInt;
    TakeIntByValue(myInt); // here, myInt is copied into myIntParameter
}
```

At the point where we call the function, a copy of the *myInt* variable is created, and that's the function's argument.

This is called passing a parameter by value; and passing by value implies making a copy. It's a perfectly valid, useful, and sometimes necessary thing to do. For example, if you want to pass a parameter to an asynchronous function known as a *coroutine*, then you'll definitely want to pass that parameter by value. There's more info on that scenario in [Concurrency and asynchronous operations with C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/concurrency#parameter-passing).

It's common to pass primitive types such as `int` and `float` by value. Anything that's no bigger than the size of a memory address (8 bytes on a 64-bit architecture machine) is perfectly appropriate for passing by value. The reason for that will become clearer in the next few posts.
