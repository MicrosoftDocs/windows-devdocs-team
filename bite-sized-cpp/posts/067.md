# #67. Functions that take references (Part 1)

Here's a different function. Different name; different syntax. Take a look at it, and have a think about what it does&mdash;specifically, what effect does it have on the parameter that it takes?

```cpp
void AddOneByReference(MyClass& myClassParameter)
{
    ++myClassParameter.Count;
}
```

If you're unsure, then look back at [#60. Reference types in C++](060.md) and [#62. Modifying via a reference](062.md), and look carefully at how the *myClassRef* variable behaves in those examples.

In those posts the type of *myClassRef* is a *reference to a* **MyClass**. And in the function above the type of *myClassParameter* is also a reference to a **MyClass**. So you can expect *myClassParameter* to behave with respect to its referent in the same way that *myClassRef* behaved with respect to *its* referent.

When we increment `myClassParameter.Count`, we increment the *Count* member of whatever the referent of *myClassParameter* is.

And next time let's see specifically what that means for code that calls the **AddOneByReference** function.
