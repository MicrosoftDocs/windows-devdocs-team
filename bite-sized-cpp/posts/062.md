# #62. Accessing via a reference

Let's add a little more code to the example that we showed in the previous post.

```cpp
MyClass myClass;
MyClass& myClassRef{ myClass };
std::wcout << myClass.Count << std::endl;
std::wcout << myClassRef.Count << std::endl;
```

Accessing the value of `myClass.Count` (in order to print it out) probably doesn't need explaining. But what about accessing the value of `myClassRef.Count`? Accessing via a reference. How does that work?

Here are the steps that the compiler generates when we print out the value of `myClassRef.Count`.

* Look up the memory address stored in *myClassRef*.
* Consider what type of reference *myClassRef* is. In this case, it's a reference to a **MyClass**.
* So interpret the series of bytes that begin at that memory address as a **MyClass** object.
* Access the value of the *Count* member of that interpreted **MyClass** object.
* Print that value out.

Of course, that interpreted **MyClass** object (the referent) is none other than the *myClass* variable itself. So we're accessing that variable's *Count* member twice: first directly via *myClass*, and then indirectly via the *myClassRef* reference to *myClass*.

Next time, we'll look at modifying via a reference.
