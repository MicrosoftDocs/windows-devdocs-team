# #66. Functions that take values (Part 3)

So now let's see what happens when we call the **AddOneByValue** function.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
...
int main()
{
    MyClass myClass; // myClass::Count initializes itself to zero (default member initializer)
    AddOneByValue(myClass); // here, myClass is copied into myClassParameter
    std::wcout << myClass.Count << std::endl;
}
```

At the point where we call the function, a copy of the *myClass* variable is created, and that becomes the function's argument. Because the function modifies only that copy, the modification has no effect on the *myClass* variable inside the **main** function. Consequently, the output here is the number 0.

As we've said, passing by value is common, and sometimes necessary. Just be aware that passing by value involves taking a copy. And that *might* be expensive (depending on the parameter's type; it's not expensive for primitive types). Also be aware that any modification that the function makes to its own copy of the parameter doesn't affect the variable that you passed to the function.

If you want a function to affect the variable that you pass to it (and/or if you want to avoid the expense of copying), then you have to pass the parameter in a different way. As we'll see next time.
