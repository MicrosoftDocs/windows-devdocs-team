# #95 A constructor that assigns to data members

The default constructor that we saw last time was a no-op. So it didn't exactly fulfil the purpose of a constructor (which is to initialize the contents of a class or structure object). So here's a structure with a default constructor that actually *does* initialize the object.

```cpp 
struct MyStruct
{
    MyStruct()
    {
        Count = 0;
    }
    int Count;
};
```

Because in this constructor we're giving a value to the *Count* data member (and because that constructor is the only way to construct a **MyStruct**), we're able to remove the default member initializer from the declaration of *Count*, as you can see.

And, yes, that constructor does initialize an instance of **MyStruct**. But it does so by *assigning* a value to *Count*. Is there a way to *initialize* the *Count* data member from within a constructor, instead of assigning to it? Why, yes there is. And it involves syntax known as a *member initializer list*. We'll see that in action next time.
