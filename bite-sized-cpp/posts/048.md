# #48. Uniform initialization (Part 2)

Here's a repeat of the first example from last time (which used legacy initialization). But this time that example is immediately followed by an updated version (which uses uniform initialization).

```cpp
float f1 = 3.14f; // legacy initialization
float f2{ 3.14f }; // uniform initialization
```

Notice how with uniform initialization there's no equals sign that might potentially be confused for an assignment. And here are some more examples, based on code that we've seen in previous posts.

```cpp
float answer1 = m.XDividedByY(1.f, 0.f); // legacy initialization
float answer2{ m.XDividedByY(1.f, 0.f) }; // uniform initialization

float answer1 = x / y; // legacy initialization
float answer2{ x / y }; // uniform initialization

auto it1 = fruit.begin(); // legacy initialization
auto it2{ fruit.begin() }; // uniform initialization
```

And here's an example from the C++/WinRT topic that introduces [concurrency and async](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/concurrency).

```cppwinrt
SyndicationFeed syndicationFeed1 = co_await syndicationClient.RetrieveFeedAsync(rssFeedUri); // legacy initialization
SyndicationFeed syndicationFeed2{ co_await syndicationClient.RetrieveFeedAsync(rssFeedUri) }; // uniform initialization
```

This has been far from an exhaustive treatment of uniform initialization, but I just wanted you to be able to recognize it when you see it. Stroustrup says more about it in [Uniform initialization syntax and semantics](https://www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html#uniform-init).

Watch out for uniform initialization being used in code examples going forward. In fact, we'll use it in the very next post.
