# #39. Writing a string to output (Part 2)

Instead of using those old functions [**printf**](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/printf-printf-l-wprintf-wprintf-l) and **wprintf**, you'll probably want to use the more general C++ *streams*.

The C++ Standard Library includes the i/o [stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/what-a-stream-is) classes. Programming with streams can be a little verbose, but they're very flexible, object-oriented, and extensible. For example, the header file `iostream` defines [**std::wcout**](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/iostream#wcout), which represents standard wide-character output.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
std::wcout << L"Pi is approximately " << std::fixed << std::setprecision(2) << 22.f / 7.f << L"." << std::endl;
// Prints "Pi is approximately 3.14" with a line-break after it.
```

You'll notice that header files `iostream` and `iomanip` don't have `.h` in their name. That's because names of headers in the C++ Standard Library omit the `.h`. On the other hand, names of headers in the C standard I/O library *do* end with `.h`. Some headers exist in both libraries&mdash;for example, `cstdio.h` (a C header) and `cstdio` (a C++ header).

What kinds of things can flow down a stream? Well, things such as user input/output, a text file, a binary file, audio/video, in fact any object that can be stored or made into a serial form. In the listing above, the `<<` syntax shows what's called the *insertion* operator at work ([**operator<<**](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/ostream-operators)), writing to an output stream. There's also the *extraction* operator([**operator>>**](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/istream-operators)), which is used for reading from an input stream.

You can override **operator<<** for use with any output stream. That way, existing source code that uses that operator will work even with output stream types that haven't yet been written. Similarly, you can override **operator>>** for use with any output stream, whether existing or future. And of course you can write your own stream classes for use with the insertion and extraction operators.

Let's come back and finish talking about C++ streams soon, after we've spent a few posts looking at C++ containers, iterators, and for-loops.
