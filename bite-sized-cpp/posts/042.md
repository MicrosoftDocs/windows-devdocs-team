# #42. C++ iterators with `do-while` and `while`

Instead of printing out only the first fruit, let's print them all. The C++ [`do-while`](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/do-while-statement-cpp) statement works the same way it does in C#.

```cpp
auto it = fruit.begin();
do
{
    std::wcout << *it << L" is a fruit" << std::endl;
    ++it; // move the iterator to point to the next element.
} while (it != fruit.end());
```

Since an iterator is very much like a pointer, we can increment one to point to the next element. The [**end**](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/vector-class#end) function returns a value that represents an iterator that points *one past the last element* in the collection. Since there's no element there, how can that be useful, since you can't dereference it? Well, we can use **end** to tell us when we've reached the end of the collection. When you're pointing at the last element, you're not at the end. When you're *one past the last element*, *then* you're at the end!

Similarly, the C++ [`while`](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/while-statement-cpp) statement works the same way it does in C#. And we use **end** in the same way.

```cpp
auto it = fruit.begin();
while (it != fruit.end())
{
    std::wcout << *it << L" is a fruit" << std::endl;
    ++it; // move the iterator to point to the next element.
}
```
