# #1. Why C++?

Before going into the technicalities of the language, let's address the question of why folks use the C++ programming language in the first place. Or why, more specifically, you might want to port a C# app to [C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/index) [1].

C++ is basically a good choice when correctness, quality, and performance are vital. Think systems programming; resource-constrained embedded and mobile systems; games and graphics; device drivers; and industrial, scientific, and medical applications [2].

Besides, modern C++ (from C++11 onward) is actually quite a bit like C#. At least, it's a ton more like C# than it used to be! C++ is still about "authoring and consuming abstractions that are both type-rich and lightweight" (to quote [Stroustrup](https://www.stroustrup.com/)). But you don't have to get mired down any longer in bug-prone raw pointers, raw loops, and painstaking memory allocation and releasing. These days, C++ is a lot more about clear expression of ideas, simplicity, readability, and a much lower likelihood of introducing bugs.

And then [C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/index) came along and gave C++ a boost. By the way, did you know that C++/WinRT *performs better and produces smaller binaries* than any other language option for the Windows Runtime! It even outperforms code handwritten directly against the application binary interface (ABI: the COM-like underpinnings of the Windows Runtime). Build times are even getting shorter [3].

And now the [Windows App SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK) is, in turn, giving C++/WinRT a boost, and opening it up to new types of apps and new audiences. So there are compelling reasons to get onto the C++ learning curve.

And that's what this series of daily bite-sized posts is all about. Take one bite per day for a shallow on-ramp to ISO Standard C++, C++/WinRT, and programming with C++ and the [Windows App SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/).
