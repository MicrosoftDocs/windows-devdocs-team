# #11. Why not choose Rust over C++?

Let's address another couple of readers' questions (one today; one next time). We learned in the first post ([#1. Why C++?](001.md)) that performance and correctness are important selling points for a system programming language such as C++ (over, say, C#'s different but equally compelling selling points, such as developer productivity and relative ease of use).

But there are other, newer, system programming languages&mdash;Rust and D, for example. Those newer languages are offered as improvements over C++, whether in terms of safety, productivity, or whatnot.

You can find more info about Rust in [Overview of developing on Windows with Rust](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/rust/overview) and [Rust for Windows, and the *windows* crate](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/rust/rust-for-windows).

So these days why would anyone choose C++ over, say, Rust?

As we know, [Stack Overflow's annual developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) shows Rust to be the best-loved programming language by far, year after year. On the other hand, the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) shows that (at least, at the time of writing) Rust isn't used anywhere near as much as, say, C++ and C#. Although, again at time of writing, Rust is moving up through that chart at a very good pace. Yes, a large number of people love Rust. But getting the opportunity to use it might be a different proposition.

Choosing C++ at this moment in time will map to plenty of training, and plenty of work. Meanwhile, I hope to see Rust's prevalence keep trending upward, because I think that a freshly designed language like that, with far less historical baggage, is a great way forward in the long term. If you're interested in Rust, and you're confident that it'll take off even more than it has, then you have the option to start ramping up on that: I can recommend the online [Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/#the-rust-programming-language).
