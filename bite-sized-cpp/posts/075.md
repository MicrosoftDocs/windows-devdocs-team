# #75. Returning a value

Here's a structure that we've seen before. It has a public function named **Count** that returns the value of a private data member named *m_count*.

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    int Count() { return m_count; }
private:
    int m_count{ 0 };
};
```

And here's some code that uses **MyStruct**.

```cpp
MyStruct myStruct;
std::wcout << myStruct.Count() << std::endl;
```

That prints 0, of course. The integer that **MyStruct::Count** returns is what's known as a [*temporary object*](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/temporary-objects) (or just *temporary* for short). That temporary object is a copy of *myStruct::m_count*.

It's fine, of course, to read the value of that temporary. We have to read it in order to print it out. You can *read* a temporary, but you can't *modify* one.

```cpp
++myStruct.Count(); // error C2105
myStruct.Count() = 2; // error C2106
```

The messages for those compile errors talk about needing for an operand/operator a thing called an *lvalue*. As we've said, the expression `myStruct.Count()` evaluates to a temporary, and a temporary *isn't* an *lvalue*. If you're curious to know more about lvalues, then see [An lvalue has identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/cpp-value-categories#an-lvalue-has-identity).
