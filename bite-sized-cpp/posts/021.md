# #21. Error handling (Part 1)

Consider this structure, and its member function:

```cpp
struct MathLibStruct
{
    float XDividedByY(float x, float y){ return x / y; };
};
```

**XDividedByY** is a function that takes two float parameters x and y, and returns a float value containing the result of dividing x by y.

Most of the time that function will work fine. But what happens if the argument for y is zero? Incidentally, although you declare named *parameters* in your source code, at run-time the machine passes and receives and processes *arguments* (actual values).

Division by zero is undefined in mathematics, so the function can't return anything meaningful. The best it can do is to return a float with a special value. If you try to take the square root of -1, then the [Microsoft C++ compiler (MSVC)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/) returns a special value of *NaN* (not a number). But for division by zero, it returns a special value of *inf*.

You can't do any meaningful further processing with a *NaN* or an *inf*. You can detect that you have one, though, and take appropriate action to work around (and/or remedy) the situation. So here's how you could create a **MathLibStruct** object, call **XDividedByY** on it, and call [**isinf**](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/isinf) to test for *inf*:

```cpp
MathLibStruct m;
float answer = m.XDividedByY(1.f, 0.f);
if (isinf(answer)) { /* Take appropriate action */ }
```

Next time we'll talk about other error-handling options.
