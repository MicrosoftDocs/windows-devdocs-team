# #20. Class/struct declarations

Last time, we talked about class/struct definitions. Today we'll consider what a class/struct *declaration* is. Here's one:

```cpp
// MathLibStruct.h
struct MathLibStruct; // A class/struct declaration
```

As you can see, we're just *mentioning* (*declaring*) the class/struct; we're not *defining* it in terms of saying what members it has. Why would you ever do that, though? Well, consider these two class/struct definitions in the same header.

```cpp
// MyStructures.h
struct MyStruct // A class/struct definition
{
    MyOtherStruct & r; // Error!
};

struct MyOtherStruct // Another class/struct definition
{
    MyStruct & r;
};
```

The C++ compiler doesn't look ahead like the C# compiler does. So when it reaches **MyStruct**, the compiler has no idea what type the *r* data member is supposed to reference (we'll talk more about references soon). As you can see, switching the file order of the two class/struct definitions doesn't help.

In this case, you need to *forward declare* (but not define) one of the classes/structs; then define the other; then define the one you declared. This will compile:

```cpp
// MyStructures.h
struct MyOtherStruct; // A class/struct declaration

struct MyStruct // A class/struct definition
{
    MyOtherStruct & r; // Ok: MyOtherStruct is declared
};

struct MyOtherStruct // Another class/struct definition
{
    MyStruct & r; // Ok: MyStruct is defined
};
```

And that's what a class/struct *declaration* (or *forward declaration*) is for.
