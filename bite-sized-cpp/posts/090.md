# #90 Free functions vs member functions

In [#84. Identity (Part 3)](084.md), we saw what I described as a general-purpose function to compare two **MyStruct** objects member-wise.

```cpp
bool CompareMembers(MyStruct const& myStructRef1, MyStruct const& myStructRef2)
{
    return (myStructRef1.Count == myStructRef2.Count);
}
```

The **CompareMembers** function doesn't belong to any class (it's not a member function). It's floating around freely, and that kind of independent function is known as a *free function*. Because it's not a member function, we can't use the `this` keyword inside **CompareMembers**.

Conversely, the **operator==** function that we've been looking at *does* belong to a class (it *is* a member function). And that's why we *can* use the `this` keyword inside it.

```cpp
// MyStruct.cpp
bool MyStruct::operator==(MyStruct const& rhs)
{
    return (Count == rhs.Count);
}
```

There I've shown **operator==** as it would appear in a `.cpp` file. The member function's name is qualified by the class or struct that it belongs to. So its full name is **MyStruct::operator==**. Remember, when you define a member function inside the class or struct definition (typically in a header file), you omit the `MyStruct::` part.
