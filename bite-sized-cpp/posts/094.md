# #94 A user-defined default constructor

If you *do* define a special member function, then the compiler *won't* generate its own. For example, here's a structure that defines a default constructor. The full name of the constructor below is **MyStructUserDefinedConstructor::MyStructUserDefinedConstructor**.

```cpp 
struct MyStructUserDefinedConstructor
{
    MyStructUserDefinedConstructor() {}
    int Count{ 0 };
};

int main()
{
    MyStructUserDefinedConstructor s5; // s5::Count == 0
    auto s6{ MyStructUserDefinedConstructor() }; // s6::Count == 0
    MyStructUserDefinedConstructor s7{}; // s7::Count == 0
}
```

Variables *s5*, *s6*, and *s7* above all cause our user-defined default constructor to be invoked. In this case there's nothing interesting going on in our user-defined default constructor (it's the same as the one the compiler would've generated for us). But for **MyStructUserDefinedConstructor**, there is a noteworthy consequence to defining a constructor, as you can see below.

```cpp
int main()
{
    MyStructUserDefinedConstructor s8{ 99 }; // error C2440
}
```

Variable *s8* causes a compile error. In the previous post, **MyStructCompilerGeneratedFunctions** was an aggregate, and that's why we were able to use aggregate initialization with it (a form of uniform initialization). We can't use aggregate initialization with **MyStructUserDefinedConstructor**, though, because it isn't an aggregate. Remember, an aggregate must have *no user-defined constructors* (see [#92 Aggregates](092.md)). But we'll soon see how we *can* use an initializer list to initialize a non-aggregate.
