# #46. Range-based `for` (Part 3)

When you provide **begin** and **end** functions for a type, you can then use that type in a range-based for-loop. The loop calls your **begin** to get an iterator, it dereferences that to provide your loop variable, and then it continues to increment the iterator as long as its value is *not* equal to the value returned by your **end**.

In this next example, the **MyRange** type provides its own **begin** and **end**; and so we can use an instance of it in a range-based for-loop. This example is admittedly simplified, and a bit contrived; and it tells only part of the story. A full explanation wouldn't fit in a bite-sized post, but even if all the details aren't clear I hope that this example at least represents evidence that you *can* extend the range-based `for` statement to work with your own types.

```cpp
struct OnePastTheLastChar
{
    friend bool operator!=(char const* ptr, OnePastTheLastChar) { return *ptr; }
};
struct MyRange
{
    char const* begin() const { return "range"; }
    OnePastTheLastChar end() const { return {}; }
};
...
for (auto const& el : MyRange())
{
    std::wcout << el << std::endl;
}
```

What does the example above do? It prints out the characters 'r', 'a', 'n', 'g', and 'e' in turn; each character on its own line.

Before we return to talking about C++ streams, next time I'd like to take a brief detour and mention uniform initialization.
