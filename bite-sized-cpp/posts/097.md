# #97 A default constructor that's explicitly defaulted

There are a couple of interesting bits of syntax that you can use with special member functions. We'll look at one in this post (`= default`), and one in the next (`= delete`).

We've seen that if you don't define a default constructor yourself, then the compiler generates a default implementation for you (a default implementation of a default constructor). By omitting your own implementation, you get an implicitly defaulted default constructor.

Alternatively, you can *explicitly* ask for a default implementation of a default constructor. In other words, an [*explicitly* defaulted](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/explicitly-defaulted-and-deleted-functions) default constructor. And you do that by using the syntax `= default`, like this.

```cpp 
struct MyStructExplicitlyDefaultedConstructor
{
    MyStructExplicitlyDefaultedConstructor() = default;
    int Count{ 0 };
};
```

In place of the body of the default constructor, you just say `= default`, and the compiler generates *what it would have generated* if you'd just omitted a constructor altogether. But this way you're making your intent clear.

Because this doesn't count as a *user-defined constructor*, **MyStructExplicitlyDefaultedConstructor** is an aggregate. So we're back to being able to use aggregate initialization with it.

```cpp
int main()
{
    MyStructExplicitlyDefaultedConstructor s1; // s1::Count == 0
    auto s2{ MyStructExplicitlyDefaultedConstructor() }; // s2::Count == 0
    MyStructExplicitlyDefaultedConstructor s3{}; // s3::Count == 0
    MyStructExplicitlyDefaultedConstructor s4{ 99 }; // s4::Count == 99
}
```
