# #96 Member initializer lists

A [member initializer list](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/constructors-cpp#member_init_list) is part of the definition of a constructor. It appears immediately before the body of the definition. Here's what a member initializer list looks like.

```cpp 
MyStruct() : Count{ 0 }
{
}
```

So it's a colon followed by one or more uniform initialization-looking initializers. The example above initializes the *Count* data member to zero. And if you have more than one data member, then you can add more than one initializer to the member initializer list, like this.

```cpp 
struct MyOtherStruct
{
    MyOtherStruct() : DataMember1{ 0 }, DataMember2{ 0 }
    {
    }
    int DataMember1;
    int DataMember2;
};
```

And of course you don't need to initialize everything to zero, either. We'll see more interesting examples of member initializer lists when we move on from default constructors (which we'll do very soon).
