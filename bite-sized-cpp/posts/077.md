# #77. Returning a reference to a local variable

This post is about something that you might be tempted to do, or that you might do by mistake. Either way, it's to be avoided. I'll illustrate with yet another version of **MyStruct**.

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    int& Count()
    {
        int count{ 0 };
        return count;
    }
};
```

This is all kinds of wrong and dangerous! What we're doing there is returning a reference to a local variable, and that's a big no-no.

Here, *count* is an automatic local variable. So it's going to go out of scope when the public function **Count** exits. It'll go out of scope, and the storage that was allocated for it will no longer be valid.

So essentially any use we make of the **Count** function is bound to be broken.

```cpp
int main()
{
    MyStruct myStruct;
    ++myStruct.Count(); // error! The local var count is no longer valid
    myStruct.Count() = 2; // ditto
    std::wcout << myStruct.Count() << std::endl; // ditto
}
```

You might get away with the above code (or something equally simple) not crashing. Every call to `myStruct.Count()` evaluates to a fresh reference to a int that's just gone out of scope (so possibly hasn't been overwritten yet). So the best you can expect to be output is 0. But be aware that if you do this (return a reference to a local variable), then eventually it'll bite you.
