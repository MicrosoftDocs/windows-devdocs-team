# #70. Naming conventions (snake_case)

Naming conventions are about the consistent use of case and prefixes (and things like that) in names. Benefits include consistency, predictability, readability, and the freedom to focus on more important concerns during code reviews.

In snake case, all lower-case characters are used, and each space (if any) is replaced by an underscore. I haven't used it so far in these posts, but you'll see snake case used a lot in C++ source code. Here's an example type name and public member name using snake case.

```cpp
struct my_struct
{
    int count();
};
```

Other examples include [**std::wstring**](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/string-typedefs#wstring) and [**winrt::box_value**](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/cpp-ref-for-winrt/box-value).

For single-word names, of course, snake case is the same as lower-case.
