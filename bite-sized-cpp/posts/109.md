# #109 Virtual functions and pure virtual functions

Look back at **WheeledMotorVehicle::Drive** and **Car::Drive** in [#108 Overriding](108.md). As we said, you could think of those as *actual* functions. But C++ has a feature called [*virtual* functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/virtual-functions), and they enable a thing known as *dynamic dispatch*. Which we'll explain after we see how to declare and override a virtual function syntactically.

```cpp
struct WheeledMotorVehicle
{
    virtual void Drive() { /* base-class implementation goes here */ }
};

struct Car : public WheeledMotorVehicle
{
    void Drive() override { /* overridden implementation goes here */ }
};
```

What dynamic dispatch means, and what virtual functions enable, is that a function can take a reference or a pointer to a **WheeledMotorVehicle** object, and it can dynamically (meaning, at run-time) figure out whether that object is a **WheeledMotorVehicle**, or whether it's something derived from **WheeledMotorVehicle** (such as a **Car**). Having figured that out, it can then call the implementation of **Drive** that belongs to the argument, and not necessarily just the implementation that belongs to the argument's declared type (which is a reference or a pointer to **WheeledMotorVehicle**).

In the next post we'll return to the hierarchy of graphics shapes that we described in [#106 Polymorphism](106.md), and put all the pieces into place.

Before that, here's a pure virtual function. The distinction being simply that a pure virtual function has no implementation.

```cpp
struct WheeledMotorVehicle
{
    virtual void Drive() = 0;
};
```
