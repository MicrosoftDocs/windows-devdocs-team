# #51. The **std::for_each** algorithm (Part 1)

C++ has a **std::for_each** (it's part of the C++ Standard Library, in the `<algorithm>` header). And it's *different* from C#'s `foreach` statement.

This post (and the second part of it) is just so that **std::for_each** can make a cameo appearance. We won't go into it in enormous depth; to do so, we ought to first fully discuss algorithms, function objects, and lambda expressions (or *lambdas*, for short). Instead, we'll just gloss over those things, and defer a proper discussion of them for another time.

But in a nutshell, the way **std::for_each** works is that it iterates over a range, and it passes each element to a function (or function-like object). The range can be any range delimited by any two iterators (in this example we're going simply between **begin** and **end**). The function (or function-like object) can be anything that *behaves* like a function.

The example below is a rewrite of **BuildClipboardFormatsOutputString** to use **std::for_each** instead of range-based `for`. And it uses a [lambda](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/lambda-expressions-in-cpp), which you can think of as a kind of embedded function that's anonymous (it has no name). The lambda just outputs each element in turn, from **begin** to **end**.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
std::wstring BuildClipboardFormatsOutputString2()
{
    DataPackageView clipboardContent{ Clipboard::GetContent() };
    std::wostringstream output;

    if (clipboardContent && clipboardContent.AvailableFormats().Size() > 0)
    {
        output << L"Available formats on the clipboard:" << std::endl;
        auto formats{ clipboardContent.AvailableFormats() };
        std::for_each(formats.begin(), formats.end(), [&](auto const& format)
        {
            output << L" * " << std::wstring_view(format) << std::endl; 
        });
    }
    else
    {
        output << L"The clipboard is empty" << std::endl;
    }

    return output.str();
}
```

More on **std::for_each** soon (after a brief, but relevant, detour into the interesting concepts of *procedure* and *policy* in C++ programming).
