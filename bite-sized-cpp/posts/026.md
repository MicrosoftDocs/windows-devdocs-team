# #26. Best practices with exceptions (Part 1)

Throwing and catching C++ exceptions is very convenient. And code written to throw and catch exceptions can be very simple, and easy to read. An exception that's never thrown is, of course, free in terms of run-time performance. But when an exception *is* thrown, the mechanics of it can be relatively expensive at run-time. For that reason, it's best to save C++ exceptions for situations that really are exceptions to the rule.

So for best performance don't throw exceptions to pass values or messages around within your app. Don't throw them to control the normal flow of execution.

Don't throw an exception that you *expect* to catch (if you expect errors, then use error/result codes). Throw exceptions that you don't *expect* to catch; but that you're *prepared for* should some unexpected run-time error occur (and in some cases you'll be able to recover from the error).

There will also be cases where, after your app has terminated due to an unhandled exception, you'll realize that you passed an invalid parameter to a function or method. Once you've fixed your code, there will then be no reason to add code to handle that exception. More on that point next time.
