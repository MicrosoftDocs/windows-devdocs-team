# #101 Constant data members

When you use the [`const`](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/const-cpp) keyword with a data member (or with a global or local variable), you indicate that the data must be initialized, and then must remain unchanged after that. The compiler helps out by reporting errors if you don't initialize, or if you try to modify, any `const` data.

Now, *as long as you use a C++11-compliant compiler*, you actually can both declare and define a constant instance (that is, non-static) data member at the same time. Like this:

```cpp
struct MathLibStruct
{
    const float Pi { 3.14159274f };
};
```

But prior to the C++11 standard, you couldn't do that. You had to provide the initial value in a member initializer list (see [#96 Member initializer lists](096.md)).

You can also combine `static` and `const` when you need to. And in fact, in addition to *MathLibStruct::Pi* being non-modifiable, we actually do want just a single copy of it. So this is better:

```cpp
struct MathLibStruct
{
    static const float Pi;
};

const float MathLibStruct::Pi{ 3.14159274f }; // Initialize a static outside the type definition.

int main()
{
    std::wcout << MathLibStruct::Pi << std::endl;
}
```

Because *Pi* is now static, we need to initialize it *outside* of the type definition.
