# #59. Initializer lists (Part 2)

Here's the version of **MyStruct** that we'll be using in this post.

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    int Member1;
    int Member2;
};
```

Now consider the following instances of **MyStruct** (in terms of initialization).

```cpp
int main()
{
    MyStruct myStruct; // members are undefined
    MyStruct myStruct1{ }; // members are 0 and 0
    MyStruct myStruct2{ 99 }; // members are 99 and 0
    MyStruct myStruct3{ 98, 99 }; // members are 98 and 99
}
```

The comments in the code there reveal the initial values of the members of each of those instances. So taking the union of all the specific examples in the last few posts, we can collect together these general rules.

* If there's no initializer list (the variable *myStruct* is the example of that), then members with no default member initializer are undefined.
* If there *is* an initializer list (even if it's empty), then *all* members are initialized in some way or another.
* More specifically, if there's an entry in the initializer list for a member, then it gets that value.
* If there *isn't* an entry in the initializer list for a member, then:
  * If that member has no default member initializer, then it's zero-initialized.
  * If that member has a default member initializer, then that's what it's initialized to.
