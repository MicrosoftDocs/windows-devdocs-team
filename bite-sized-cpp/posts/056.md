# #56. Initializing a struct to *any* value

Just a short post to show the same **MyStruct** structure from last time in action again. Except this time there's a third instance of **MyStruct**.

```cpp
int main()
{
    MyStruct myStruct1; // problem: uninitialized
    MyStruct myStruct2{}; // ok: zero-initialized
    MyStruct myStruct3{ 99 }; // ok: initialized
}
```

Last time, we saw that you can use an *empty* pair of curly brackets to zero-initialize the members of a variable to zero. That's what *myStruct2* does. But *myStruct3* uses a *specific value* within curly brackets to initialize its data member. If **MyStruct** had more than one data member, then we could provide more than one value. We'll see that demonstrated next time.
