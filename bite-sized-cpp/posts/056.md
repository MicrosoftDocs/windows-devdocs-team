# #56. Initializing a struct to *any* value

Here's the same **MyStruct** structure from last time in action again. Except this time there's a third instance of **MyStruct**.

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    int Count;
};

int main()
{
    MyStruct myStruct1; // problem: uninitialized
    MyStruct myStruct2{}; // ok: zero-initialized
    MyStruct myStruct3{ 99 }; // ok: initialized
}
```

Last time, we saw that you can use an *empty* pair of curly brackets to zero-initialize the members of a variable to zero. That's what *myStruct2* does. But *myStruct3* uses a *specific value* within curly brackets to initialize its data member. If **MyStruct** had more than one data member, then we could provide more than one value. We'll see that demonstrated next time.

Incidentally, this particular version of **MyStruct** is a special kind of class/structure known as an *aggregate*. An aggregate is a class or a structure that has no user-defined constructors, and all of its data members are public. It's essentially a data structure (a simple collection of public fields). It's an aggregate of elements, where those elements are its fields.
