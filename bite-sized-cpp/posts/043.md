# #43. The for-loop

C++ has a few variants on the for-loop. But the regular [C++ `for` statement](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/for-statement-cpp) works very much like its counterpart in C#.

You initialize the loop; you define the condition that keeps the loop running as long as the condition's true; and you typically increment one or more loop variables each time through the loop (each iteration).

```cpp
for (auto it = fruit.begin(); it != fruit.end(); ++it)
{
    std::wcout << *it << L" is a fruit" << std::endl;
}
```

As you can see, the `for` statement contains all the same pieces that the `do-while` and the `while` contain. But the `for` gathers those pieces together, so it's a little more compact and readable.

In the example above, we're still using an iterator (the *it* variable). And we're still using the convenient [**end**](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/vector-class#end) function in the condition, and we're still dereferencing the iterator in order to print it out. Thanks to that iterator (and the **end** function), there's still no need to use an index variable.

Incidentally, if we *were* to use indexing instead of an iterator, then that'd look like this:

```cpp
for (std::vector<std::wstring>::size_type ix = 0; ix < fruit.size(); ++ix)
{
    std::wcout << fruit[ix] << L" is a fruit" << std::endl;
}
```

Next time, we'll look at C++'s even more elegant range-based `for`-loop.
