# #44. Range-based `for` (Part 2)

You can use the range-based `for` with things that might not look immediately like they're a collection (or a *range*)&mdash;for example, a string.

```cpp
for (auto const& el : std::wstring{ L"example string" })
{
    std::wcout << el << std::endl;
}
```

A range-based for-loop looks like it's not using iterators. But under the covers it actually *is* using iterators. Range-based `for` can work with any object that represents a range, and that has **begin** and **end** functions. It's is an extensibility idea similar to the way C#'s `foreach` statement works with any type that implements **IEnumerable**.

The range object's **begin** and **end** functions must return a value that either *is* an iterator, or else can function like one. And because **begin** and **end** don't *need* to be member functions&mdash;they can be free functions&mdash;you can write them for any type; even a type whose source code you don't have access to.

We'll pick this up next time.
