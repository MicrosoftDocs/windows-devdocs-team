# #29. Why doesn't C++ have a `finally` construct? (Part 1)

Believe it or not, this (short) post sets us up for a long, and very interesting, diversion *away* from exceptions for a few posts (possibly for more than a few) into the subject of C++ resource management.

If you know C#, then you'll know that in C# the `finally` block is about releasing resources (and releasing them whether or not an exception was thrown). In post [#24. Throwing and catching exceptions (Part 2)](024.md), I mentioned that C++ doesn't have C#'s `finally` blocks. This post begins the story of why C++ doesn't need them.

Let's think about what happens when an exception is raised in a C++ `try` block. Execution passes to a `catch` block, and that interrupts whatever function or operation was in flight at that moment. And any variables declared in the `try` block immediately go out of scope; and that means that any objects that were created immediately go out of scope.

In the *early* days of C++, those things would have been potential problems. We'll see exactly what kind of problems next time with a code example written in the form of vintage C++.
