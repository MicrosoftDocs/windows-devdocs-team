# #40. C++ containers

When it comes to collections (and iterating over them), the [C++ Standard Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference) has some great gadgets. Collection types are called *containers*. And you can iterate over them using things called *iterators*. In terms of containers, there are vectors, lists, arrays, maps, stacks, queues, and more.

Let's look at vectors first. Here's a vector that contains wide strings.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
...
std::vector<std::wstring> fruit;
```

The angle bracket syntax reads as "vector of string". We can talk more about that syntax in future when we get around to C++ templates.

Here's how you can add elements to this container.

```cpp
fruit.push_back(L"pear");
fruit.push_back(L"banana");
fruit.push_back(L"pineapple");
```

You can use the [**front**](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/vector-class#front) function to access the element at the front of the vector (that is, the first element). Or you can use a zero-based index to access *any* element.

```cpp
std::wcout << fruit.front() << L" is a fruit" << std::endl;
std::wcout << fruit[0] << L" is a fruit" << std::endl;
// Both lines print "pear is a fruit" with a line-break after it.
```
