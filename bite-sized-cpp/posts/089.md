# #89 Overloading the inequality operator

An inequality operator overload is actually trivial to implement once you've overloaded the equality operator. The two operators are after all the logical complement of one another. So you can implement inequality by invoking the equality operator, and applying logical NOT (the `!` operator) to the result. Here's one way of doing that.

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    int Count{ 0 };
    bool operator==(MyStruct const& rhs)
    {
        return (Count == rhs.Count);
    }
    bool operator!=(MyStruct const& rhs)
    {
        return !(this->operator==(rhs));
    }
};
```

But calling `operator==` like that is not an elegant way to invoke the equality operator. Previously, we invoked it with a simple `x == y` expression. So now that we know about `*this`, we'll probably prefer the following much more readable and idiomatic alternative.

```cpp
bool operator!=(MyStruct const& rhs)
{
    return !(*this == rhs);
}
```
