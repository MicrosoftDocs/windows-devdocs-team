# #92 Aggregates

We introduced aggregates in [#56. Initializing a struct to *any* value](056.md); and mentioned them again in passing a couple of times. But the introduction and mentions were perhaps a bit buried. So since we will be mentioning them again, let's take the luxury of a little time to focus on aggregates, and revisit what they are.

```cpp
struct MyStruct1
{
    int Count{ 0 };
};
```

**Struct1** is a struct. But it's also an *aggregate*. To be an aggregate, a class or structure must have only *public* data members (it's ok for *static* data members not to be public). There are other rules, but they're to do with concepts we haven't covered yet:

* An aggregate must have *no user-defined constructors*;
* mustn't derive from another type;
* and mustn't define virtual functions.

Below is **Struct2**. Is it an aggregate?

```cpp
struct MyStruct2
{
    int Count{ 0 };
private:
    float SquareOf(float);
    static int m_count;
};
```

**Struct2** conforms to the rules. So, yes, it's an aggregate. How about this next version?

```cpp
struct MyStruct3
{
    int Count{ 0 };
private:
    int m_count;
};
```

In fact, no, **Struct3** is *not* an aggregate. And that's because it has a non-static, non-public data member.

Lastly, you'll also recall that *aggregate initialization* is what happens when you use [uniform initialization](047.md) (or list initialization) syntax with an aggregate type.
