# #25. Throwing and catching exceptions (Part 3)

As we said, using exceptions to handle exceptional cases means that we can leave our function signatures intact. In the case of **XDividedByY**, our first inclination was to express it as a function that takes two floats and returns a float. And we can leave it that way.

So here's how we could rewrite **XDividedByY** to test for division by zero, and throw an instance of the plain old standard [**std::exception**](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/exception-class) type if we detect that case.

```cpp
#include <exception>
struct MathLibStruct
{
    float XDividedByY(float x, float y) {
        if (y == 0.f) throw std::exception();
        return x / y;
    };
};
```

In the event that the function *does* throw the exception, then at that point the function returns (and, remember, we don't resume execution in **XDividedByY** after the exception has been handled). If the function *doesn't* throw the exception, then execution of the function continues as normal.

And here's how we can call **XDividedByY** while taking into account than an exception (of a specific, and known, type) might be thrown.

```cpp
try
{
    MathLibStruct m;
    float answer = m.XDividedByY(1.f, 0.f);
}
catch (std::exception const & /* ex */)
{
    // Take appropriate action
}
```

Remember, the more code in a `try` block, the better value the `try-catch` is. You can imagine real-world cases that get better amortization from the `try-catch` syntax than the example above does.
