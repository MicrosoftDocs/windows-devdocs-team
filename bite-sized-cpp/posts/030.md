# #30. Why doesn't C++ have a `finally` construct? (Part 2)

Consider this bit of vintage C++. It's *vintage* because folks don't program this way in C++ these days, using pointers like that.

```cpp
// VintageMathLibStruct.h
static bool busyCalculating{ false };

#include <exception>
struct VintageMathLibStruct
{
    float XDividedByY(float x, float y)
    {
        busyCalculating = true;
        if (y == 0.f) throw std::exception();
        float answer = x / y;
        busyCalculating = false;
        return answer;
    };
};

int main()
{
    try
    {
        VintageMathLibStruct * m = new VintageMathLibStruct();
        float den = 0.f;
        float answer = m->XDividedByY(1.f, den);
        delete m;
    }
    catch (std::exception const& /* ex */)
    {
        // Take appropriate action
    }
}
```

It's a somewhat contrived example, but it contains the elements we need to get the discussion underway. So can you see the problem(s) in that code listing? We'll discuss them next time.
