# #13. Classes and structures are *almost* the same thing in C++ (Part 1)

Here's a bit of a roadmap for what's coming up in the next few posts:

* The one minor difference between classes and structs.
* *Declarations* and *definitions* (two terms that you'll hear developers and the compiler use a lot, so I think it's good to be crisp on what they mean even at this early stage).
* C++ error handling.

In C++, the only difference between a class and a structure (or struct) is that the members of a structure have public access by default. Let me illustrate with these two types:

```cpp
class MathLibClass
{
    float SquareOf(float);
};

struct MathLibStruct
{
    float SquareOf(float);
};
```

**MathLibClass::SquareOf** is private, because that's the default access control for a class. You can't call a private member function from outside the class (you can call it only from inside another member function of the same class). **MathLibStruct::SquareOf**, on the other hand, is public, because that's the default access control for a structure. And that's the only difference, in C++, between classes and structures.

You'll notice how (in **MathLibClass::SquareOf**, for example), we're using the [scope resolution operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/scope-resolution-operator) again, with its double-colon.

A little more on this next time.
