# #27. Best practices with exceptions (Part 2)

At the [application binary interface (ABI) layer of the Windows Runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/interop-winrt-abi), success/failure is reported back to the caller as [**HRESULT**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes) return codes. Failure **HRESULT**s are typically converted into idiomatic exceptions in the particular language projection you're using. So for example the [C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/) language projection throws C++ exceptions in a case like that.

If you cause an exception by using an API incorrectly (passing an invalid parameter kind of thing), then fix your code, and then that code won't cause that exception again. If the exception results from a catastrophic failure, then it's unlikely you'll be able to recover from that, so you should let your app fail fast. These are the reasons (as well as exception details being specific to each language projection) that the documentation for the [Windows Runtime APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/) *typically* doesn't provide details about any exceptions that can be thrown.

Course, one or two API topics *do* contain such info, but that's because those are badly-behaved APIs that return failure **HRESULT**s for reasons other than catastrophic failures or usage errors.

Also see the topic [Error handling with C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/error-handling). That topic is framed around [C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/), but the advice in there applies to *all* Standard C++.

Remember that C++/WinRT *is* Standard C++, even though it's a Windows Runtime language projection. That fact differentiates C++/WinRT from the now-superseded C++/CX language projection, which was *not* Standard C++.

Next time, a little about multiple `catch` blocks.
