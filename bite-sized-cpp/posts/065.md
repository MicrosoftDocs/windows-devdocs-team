# #65. Functions that take values (Part 2)

Now take a look at another function, and have a think about what this one does. Specifically, think about what effect it has on the parameter that it takes.

```cpp
void AddOneByValue(MyClass myClassParameter)
{
    ++myClassParameter.Count;
}
```

If you're unsure, then look back at [#60. Value types in C++](060.md), and look carefully at the type of *myClassCopy* in that post. Its type is simply **MyClass**. And the type of *myClassParameter* in the function above is also simply **MyClass**.

Because in C++ classes and structures (as well as primitive types, such as `int` and `float`) are value types, that means that *myClassParameter* is a member-wise *copy* of whatever argument is passed to the **AddOneByValue** function. So any changes that the function makes to *myClassParameter*, it's making those changes only to the function's own copy of **MyClass** object.

Next time we'll see how that fact affects code that calls the **AddOneByValue** function.
