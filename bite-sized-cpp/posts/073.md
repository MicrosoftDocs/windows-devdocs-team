# #73. Naming conventions (private data members)

So we've talked about conventions for type names and public member names, both of which are about the public contract of a type. Within the *implementation* of a type, though, it can be useful to go with other conventions.

Here's a struct with Pascal case used for its public names; but something different used for its *private* data member.

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    int Count() { return m_count; }
private:
    int m_count{ 0 };
};
```

Why is the private data member prefixed with "m_"? It's so that when you're reading source code, you can tell that *m_count* is a member of **MyStruct** (and not some local or static or global variable). It's safer than insisting on `this->count`, because someone's bound to forget to do that. But once a member is named *m_count*, you can't exactly forget to include the "m_".

Of course, it's not possible to tell from that particular example whether the "count" part of *m_count* is meant to be a snake case or a camel case name. [C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/), in its implementation, goes with snake case&mdash;for example, it uses *m_debug_reference* as the name of one private data member within its implementation. If you want to go with camel case, then you'd name that *m_debugReference*.
