# #68. Functions that take references (Part 2)

Here's a **main** function that calls the **AddOneByReference** function that we showed last time.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
...
int main()
{
    MyClass myClass; // myClass::Count initializes itself to zero
    AddOneByReference(myClass); // here, only the memory address of myClass is passed as myClassParameter
    std::wcout << myClass.Count << std::endl;
}
```

At the point where we call the function, a reference to the *myClass* variable (the referent) is created, and that's the function's argument. Not a *value*, but a *reference*. At least, when you're thinking at normal levels of abstraction, then you should think of it as a reference (and not a value). If you want to take your thinking down to a deeper abstraction level, then what we call a reference is in fact a value containing a memory address. When you're thinking at that level of abstraction, everything is a value.

But this is called *passing a parameter by reference*. You create a reference that refers to a referent, and you pass that.

The **AddOneByReference** function increments the referent's *Count* member; and here the *myClass* variable is the referent. `myClass.Count` initialized itself to 0, so incrementing that makes it 1. So the output is the number 1.
