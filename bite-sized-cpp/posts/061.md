# #61. Reference types in C++

As a concept in C++ programming, I've used the term "reference" three times so far without properly explaining it. I'll try to remedy that.

So, still using the same **MyClass** from last time, consider this code. We won't be comparing this to C#, so I'll return to uniform initialization.

```cpp
MyClass myClass;
MyClass& myClassRef{ myClass };
```

Here, the type of the *myClassRef* variable is not simply **MyClass**. It's a *reference to a* **MyClass** (specifically, it's an *lvalue* reference; but let's not worry about that detail just yet). As we've said, classes and structures in C++ are *value types*. But we can also declare *references* to them. The syntax for making a reference has an ampersand symbol (&) in the declaration, as shown above.

Last time, with *myClassCopy*, we took a completely independent copy of the value of *myClass*. But we're not doing that in the code above. Instead we're taking only a *reference* to *myClass*. Which means that the compiler finds for us exactly where in memory *myClass* resides, and squirrels away that memory address in *myClassRef*.

Terminology-wise, *myClassRef* is a reference; *myClass* is its referent (the thing it references).

The compiler does more work, as we'll see next, whenever we access the underlying object that *myClassRef* references.
