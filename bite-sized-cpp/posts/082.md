# #82. Identity (Part 1)

Let's talk about the concept of *identity* in C++. It's interesting and useful in itself, but there's also a connection between identity and the *lvalue*. The lvalue is a term that I've mentioned in passing a couple of times. But we'll have to wait a little while yet for a proper discussion of that (unless you're keen to get a definitely not bite-sized head start on it, in which case see [Value categories, and references to them](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/cpp-value-categories)).

```cpp
MyStruct myStruct1;
MyStruct myStruct2;
```

It's obvious to us that *myStruct1* and *myStruct2* are two separate and individual *things*. They each have their own existence and identity (just like each person has their own identity). But what can an idea like *identity* mean to the C++ compiler?

Well, each of the variables *myStruct1* and *myStruct2* has storage allocated for it. That storage might be on the stack, heap, or elsewhere. But since those variables' objects have storage, we can take their memory address. And those memory addresses are unique. They have to be; at any memory address there can be at most one variable.

So, to the C++ compiler, an object's identity is its memory address. We'll have more to say about identity next time!
