# #85 Overloading the equality operator

The **CompareMembers** function from last time takes two **MyStruct** objects, and compares the values of their members. But there's a more natural way to compare two **MyStruct** objects, and it's shown below.

```cpp
if (myStruct1 == myStruct2) { ... }
```

Right now, the compiler will respond to that with [error C2676](/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-2/compiler-error-c2676), and the message "'MyStruct' does not define this operator". There's no built-in equality operator to compare two **MyStruct** objects, since **MyStruct** is a user-defined type. But we can *overload* the equality operator for **MyStruct** like this (see [Operator overloading](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/operator-overloading)).

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    int Count{ 0 };
    bool operator==(MyStruct const& rhs)
    {
        return (Count == rhs.Count);
    }
};
```

Now we can write the natural kind of code we wanted to, using the equality operator.

```cpp
MyStruct myStruct1{ 99 }; // myStruct1.Count is 99
MyStruct myStruct2; // myStruct2.Count is 0

myStruct1 = myStruct2;
_ASSERTE(myStruct1 == myStruct2);
```
