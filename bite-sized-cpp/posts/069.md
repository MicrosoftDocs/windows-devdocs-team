# #69. Passing large values around

As we've seen, when you pass a parameter by value, a copy is taken of that parameter. But when you pass by reference, no copy is taken.

So consider a large value type such as [DirectX::XMMATRIX](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/dxmath/xmmatrix-ctor). An instance of **XMMATRIX** is 64 bytes in size. Any chance you get to avoid copying one of those is going to save you time and space in your app.

```cpp
#include <DirectXMath.h>
using namespace DirectX;

void MatrixByValue(XMMATRIX matrixParameter)
{
    // Use matrixParameter.
}

void MatrixByReference(XMMATRIX& matrixParameter)
{
    // Use matrixParameter.
}

int main()
{
    XMMATRIX matrix{};
    MatrixByValue(matrix); // Causes a copy of matrix to be made
    MatrixByReference(matrix); // No copy necessary
}
```

Out of the two functions shown above, you should prefer calling **MatrixByReference** (passing by reference) if you want to avoid any unnecessary and expensive copies. That's especially good advice if you're working with values that are even larger than **XMMATRIX**'s 64 bytes.

But passing by *constant* reference is a third option for passing the *matrix* variable around, and we'll look at that next time.
