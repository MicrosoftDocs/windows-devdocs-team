# #84. Identity (Part 3)

Consider this code.

```cpp
MyStruct myStruct1{ 99 }; // myStruct1.Count is 99
MyStruct myStruct2; // myStruct2.Count is 0
myStruct1 = myStruct2; // myStruct1.Count is now 0
_ASSERTE(!CompareIdentities(myStruct1, myStruct2));
```

After the assignment, the structs have the same values in their members. But they still have different identities (the [_ASSERTE](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/assert-asserte-assert-expr-macros) helps us confirm that).

And here's a general-purpose function to compare two **MyStruct** objects member-wise.

```cpp
bool CompareMembers(MyStruct const& myStructRef1, MyStruct const& myStructRef2)
{
    return (myStructRef1.Count == myStructRef2.Count);
}

int main()
{
    MyStruct myStruct1{ 99 }; // myStruct1.Count is 99
    MyStruct myStruct2; // myStruct2.Count is 0
    myStruct1 = myStruct2;
    _ASSERTE(CompareMembers(myStruct1, myStruct2));
    _ASSERTE(CompareMembers(myStruct2, myStruct2));
}
```

Even though they still have distinct identities, after the assignment we expect the two variables to compare equal (member-wise). Needless to say, calling **CompareMembers** and passing the same identity twice also returns `true`.
